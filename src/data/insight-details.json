            "<p>The first step in any successful migration isn't choosing the cloud provider; it's mapping the current state. We often find that documentation hasn't been updated since the initial release. My approach starts with \"Forensic Requirement Analysis\"—essentially interviewing the code through database schema analysis and user behavior tracking.</p>",
            "<p>In my experience with Tier-1 banking systems, approximately 30% of legacy codebase consists of \"dead logic\"—features built for regulations that were repealed years ago or marketing campaigns that ended in the early 2000s. Identifying this debris early is crucial. It prevents the team from wasting thousands of hours migrating functionality that adds zero value to the modern business.</p>",

            "<p>During the discovery phase, we identified three critical data flows that were redundant. By creating a unified data model, we eliminated synchronization issues that had plagued the customer service team for years. The original system required nightly batch jobs to align account balances; the new architecture handled this in real-time.</p>",
            "<p>This transition wasn't just technical. It required extensive stakeholder management to convince the Risk department that real-time processing was actually <em>safer</em> than their trusted batch reports. By demonstrating the audit trail capabilities of the new event-driven architecture, we turned our biggest skeptics into our strongest advocates.</p>",
            "<p>Ultimately, the success of a monolith migration hinges on the BSA's ability to translate technical debt into business risk, and technical modernization into business velocity.</p>"
